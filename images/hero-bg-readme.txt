To create the hero background with "XCodeFreeze" text:

1. Open the hero-background.html file in your browser
2. Press F11 to go into fullscreen mode (or use your browser's fullscreen option)
3. Take a screenshot:
   - On Mac: Command+Shift+3 for full screen or Command+Shift+4 to select a region
   - On Windows: Windows+Print Screen or use the Snipping Tool
   - On Linux: PrtScn key or use your distribution's screenshot tool

4. Save the screenshot as hero-bg.jpg in the images folder

The background should be a blue gradient with "XCodeFreeze" text in a light, slightly transparent overlay that matches the site's styling.
